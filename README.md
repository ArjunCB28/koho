# KOHO

The primary objective is to identify the velocity limit of the transaction. The main program can be found in the src/app.ts file. A detailed description of various methods and properties are provided as inline comments in the same file.
The program reads the input.txt file inside the src folder. Please replace the input.txt file with different input.txt if you want to test it with another set of transactions.
The output file can be found in the dist folder.

### Pre-requisite: 
1. Node must be installed in the system
2. Clone the repo and run "npm install"

##### npm run start ->To run the program
##### npm run test ->To run the test cases written to cover unit cases and business scenarios
##### npm run lint ->To run the tsLint

### Observations:
1. I found the output.txt generated by my code and the one provided by you to be exactly the same.
2. I have covered various cases provided by KOHO in my test cases.
3. There are no tsLint errors. And, I have followed the best programming practices that I have learned.
